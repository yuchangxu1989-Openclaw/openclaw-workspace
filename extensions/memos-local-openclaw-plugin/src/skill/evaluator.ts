const CREATE_EVAL_PROMPT = `You are a strict experience evaluation expert. Based on the completed task record below, decide whether this task contains **reusable, transferable** experience worth distilling into a "skill".

A skill is a reusable guide that helps an AI agent handle **the same type of task** better in the future. The key question is: "Will someone likely need to do this exact type of thing again?"

STRICT criteria — must meet ALL of:
1. **Repeatable**: The task type is likely to recur (not a one-off personal conversation)
2. **Transferable**: The approach/solution would help others facing the same problem
3. **Technical depth**: Contains non-trivial steps, commands, code, configs, or diagnostic reasoning

Worth distilling (must meet criteria above AND at least ONE below):
- Solves a recurring technical problem with a specific approach/workflow
- Went through trial-and-error (wrong approach then corrected) — the learning is valuable
- Involves non-obvious usage of specific tools, APIs, or frameworks
- Contains debugging/troubleshooting with diagnostic reasoning
- Shows how to combine multiple tools/services to accomplish a technical goal
- Contains deployment, configuration, or infrastructure setup steps
- Demonstrates a reusable data processing or automation pipeline

NOT worth distilling (if ANY matches, return shouldGenerate=false):
- Pure factual Q&A with no process ("what is TCP", "what's the capital of France")
- Single-turn simple answers with no workflow
- Conversation too fragmented or incoherent to extract a clear process
- One-off personal tasks: identity confirmation, preference setting, self-introduction
- Casual chat, opinion discussion, news commentary, brainstorming without actionable output
- Simple information lookup or summarization (e.g. "summarize this article", "explain X concept")
- Organizing/listing personal information (work history, resume, contacts)
- Generic product/system overviews without specific operational steps
- Tasks where the "steps" are just the AI answering questions (no real workflow)

Task title: {TITLE}
Task summary:
{SUMMARY}

LANGUAGE RULE: The "reason" field MUST use the SAME language as the task title/summary. Chinese input → Chinese reason. English input → English reason. "suggestedName" stays in English kebab-case.

Reply in JSON only, no extra text:

  "shouldGenerate": boolean,
  "reason": "brief explanation (same language as input)",
  "suggestedName": "kebab-case-name",
  "suggestedTags": ["tag1", "tag2"],

Existing skill (v{VERSION}):
Name: {SKILL_NAME}
Content:
{SKILL_CONTENT}

Newly completed task:
Title: {TITLE}
Summary:
{SUMMARY}

Does the new task bring substantive improvements to the existing skill?

Worth upgrading (any one qualifies):
1. Faster — shorter path discovered
2. More elegant — cleaner, follows best practices better
3. More convenient — fewer dependencies or complexity
4. Fewer tokens — less exploration/trial-and-error needed
5. More accurate — corrects wrong parameters/steps in old skill
6. More robust — adds edge cases, error handling
7. New scenario — covers a variant the old skill didn't
8. Fixes outdated info — old skill has stale information

NOT worth upgrading:
- New task is identical to existing skill
- New task's approach is worse than existing skill
- Differences are trivial

LANGUAGE RULE: "reason" and "mergeStrategy" MUST use the SAME language as the task title/summary. Chinese input → Chinese output. English input → English output.
